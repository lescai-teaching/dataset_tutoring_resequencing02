**Patient name**: Michael

**Age**: 14 year-old

**Sex**: Male

**Chief Complaint:** Progressive exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, and fatigue.

**History of Presenting Illness:** Michael was a healthy child until the age of 10, when his parents noticed he tired more easily than his peers during soccer practice. Initially, they attributed it to growing pains. However, over the past four years, his exercise tolerance has progressively declined. He now experiences significant muscle weakness and fatigue even with mild exertion, such as walking up stairs or carrying groceries. He frequently complains of muscle cramps, particularly in his legs and arms, after minimal activity. He experiences occasional episodes of nausea and vomiting, especially after intense exercise, as well as episodes of palpitations and shortness of breath.

**Past Medical History:** Unremarkable until the onset of current symptoms. He has no history of significant illnesses, injuries, or surgeries. He denies any known allergies.

**Family History:** Michael's family history is notable for a maternal great-uncle who reportedly died in his late 20s from an "undiagnosed heart condition". His mother reports feeling tired more easily than most people, but has attributed it to stress from work. She's never undergone a full medical evaluation. Otherwise, the family history is unremarkable for neuromuscular disorders or cardiac problems.

**Social History:** Michael is a high school student. He previously enjoyed playing soccer but has had to stop due to his symptoms. He denies smoking, alcohol, or drug use.

**Physical Examination:**

*   **General:** Alert and oriented but appears fatigued.
*   **Neurological:** Muscle weakness is present in the proximal muscles of the limbs (shoulders and hips), with a strength rating of 4/5 bilaterally. Distal muscle strength is relatively preserved. Deep tendon reflexes are normal. Sensation is intact. No evidence of cognitive impairment.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Resting heart rate is 90 bpm. A soft systolic murmur is auscultated at the left sternal border. Blood pressure is normal.
*   **Respiratory:** Lungs are clear to auscultation. Respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 20 breaths per minute.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Mild muscle atrophy is noted in the proximal limb muscles. No joint abnormalities are present.
*   **Fundoscopic exam**: Normal retinal exam. No evidence of optic nerve atrophy.

**Laboratory Investigations:**

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Normal.
*   **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP):** Elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels (5x upper limit of normal). Lactate is elevated at rest.
*   **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG):** Normal at rest, but significant metabolic acidosis is observed after exercise.
*   **Lactate/Pyruvate Ratio:** Elevated.
*   **Urine Drug Screen:** Negative.
*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** Sinus tachycardia. Left ventricular hypertrophy.
*   **Echocardiogram:** Mild left ventricular hypertrophy, ejection fraction within normal limits.

**Diagnostic Clues:**

*   Progressive exercise intolerance and muscle weakness since childhood.
*   Elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, indicating muscle damage.
*   Metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate levels, particularly after exercise.
*   Family history suggestive of a potential cardiac condition in a maternal relative.
*   Elevated lactate/pyruvate ratio.
*   Cardiac involvement as evidenced by echocardiogram findings.

**Differential Diagnosis:**

Based on the presenting symptoms, family history, and diagnostic clues, the primary differential diagnosis includes a mitochondrial disorder affecting oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in impaired energy production in muscle and cardiac tissue. The possibility of other metabolic myopathies, such as glycogen storage diseases, is also considered, although the elevated lactate/pyruvate ratio makes a defect in the respiratory chain more likely. The family history of sudden cardiac death further supports the suspicion of a mitochondrial cardiac involvement.

**Further Investigations:**

*   Muscle biopsy with histochemical and biochemical analysis of the respiratory chain enzymes.
*   Genetic testing to identify mutations in genes associated with mitochondrial disorders, with particular attention to genes involved in cytochrome c oxidase assembly.
*   Cardiopulmonary exercise testing to assess the severity of the exercise intolerance and metabolic abnormalities.
